# Zaeon Dependency Analysis Summary

## Executive Summary

The Zaeon project (lapce-app crate) suffers from significant architectural debt with tight coupling and poor separation of concerns. The analysis reveals critical issues that must be addressed for maintainability and scalability.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Monolithic Architecture
- **app.rs**: 167KB file with 40+ module imports - central coordination point
- **window_tab.rs**: 113KB file with similar coupling patterns
- **editor.rs**: 147KB file mixing UI, business logic, and data access

### 2. Violation of Separation of Concerns
- Configuration accessed directly throughout codebase (config::LapceConfig)
- Database operations mixed with UI logic (db::LapceDb)
- Command handling spread across multiple layers
- Plugin system split between app and proxy with unclear boundaries

### 3. High Coupling Hotspots
| Module | Issues | Impact |
|--------|--------|---------|
| app.rs | Central coordinator importing everything | CRITICAL |
| window_tab.rs | Secondary coordinator with mixed concerns | CRITICAL |
| editor.rs | UI component with business logic | HIGH |
| config.rs + settings.rs | Direct access from all layers | HIGH |

### 4. Circular Dependency Risks
- **app.rs ↔ window_tab.rs ↔ editor.rs** triangle
- **editor.rs ↔ doc.rs ↔ completion.rs** cycle
- **panel/* ↔ window_tab.rs ↔ main_split.rs** coordination cycle

## Recommended Refactoring Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Low Risk)
1. **Dependency Analysis** ✅ COMPLETED
2. **Create Directory Structure** - Establish ui/, core/, data/, config/, plugins/, utils/

### Phase 2: Layer Extraction (Medium Risk)
3. **Configuration Layer** - Extract config management with interfaces
4. **Data Layer** - Implement repository patterns for db/doc access
5. **UI Layer** - Pure components with event-driven communication
6. **Business Logic Layer** - Service layer with dependency injection

### Phase 3: Complex Refactoring (High Risk)
7. **Plugin System** - Unify app/proxy plugin architecture
8. **Monolithic Files** - Break down app.rs and window_tab.rs

### Phase 4: Integration (Medium Risk)
9. **Module System** - Fix imports and eliminate circular dependencies
10. **Documentation** - Architecture guidelines and patterns

## Success Metrics

### Before Refactoring:
- 99 Rust files in flat structure
- 3 files >100KB (app.rs, window_tab.rs, editor.rs)
- Direct coupling between all layers
- No clear architectural boundaries

### After Refactoring Goals:
- Modular directory structure with clear boundaries
- No files >50KB (broken into focused modules)
- Layered architecture with defined interfaces
- Testable components with dependency injection
- Clear plugin system architecture

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas:
- **app.rs refactoring** - Requires careful state management extraction
- **Plugin system** - Coordination between app and proxy components
- **Import updates** - Risk of compilation failures during transition

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Incremental refactoring with continuous testing
- Interface-first approach to maintain contracts
- Feature flags for gradual rollout if needed
- Comprehensive test coverage before major changes

## Next Steps

1. **Proceed with Step 2** - Create modular directory structure
2. **Begin with configuration layer** - Lowest risk, high impact
3. **Establish testing strategy** - Ensure no regressions
4. **Create architectural documentation** - Guide future development

This analysis provides the foundation for transforming Zaeon from a tightly-coupled monolith into a well-architected, maintainable codebase with clear separation of concerns.
